# PHP Backend Developer Test Project
## Overview
This test project focuses on implementing GraphQL mutations and queries using API Platform in a Symfony environment. The project includes Docker setup with FrankenPHP and uses Doctrine for database management.

## Project Setup
The project comes with a pre-configured environment including:
- Docker & FrankenPHP
- Symfony Framework
- API Platform
- GraphQL

## Assignment Details

### Task Description
You need to implement four GraphQL endpoints with functional tests

#### Mutations:
1. Create new trades

Trade creation should be done with an auto-generated trade number (10 characters, alphanumeric). Add validations if needed. Implement saving trades and transactions to the database.

#### Queries:

2. Fetch collection of transactions

Exclude soft deleted trades and transactions from response.

## General Requirements
- All endpoints must be GraphQL-based (not REST)
